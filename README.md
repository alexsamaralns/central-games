This page contains three classic games that I developed to improve my skills in the React JS framework. In this project, Vite and React JS were mainly used. The main styling tool is the Tailwind CSS framework and some traditional CSS classes.

My intention with this project is to demonstrate my developer skills, organization and the way I work.

I hope it might be interesting to see.

Thanks for staying here!

## About

#### Tic Tac Toe
Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic paper-and-pencil game played between two players. The game is typically played on a 3x3 grid, and the players take turns marking X or O in the empty cells of the grid. The objective of the game is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of your marks (X or O) before your opponent does. If all the cells are filled and no player has formed a line of three, the game is considered a draw.

#### Rock Paper Scissors
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a hand game usually played between two people. The players simultaneously form one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are rock, paper, and scissors. The winner is determined by the rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock. If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie. It is often used as a simple method of decision-making.

#### Genius
Genius is a classic toy that has 4 buttons in green, red, yellow and blue. The objective is to repeat the same sequence shown. The game starts with a sequence of 4 steps, and as you get this sequence right it increases and the interval between the steps of the sequence when it is shown decreases. It is a very good game that can improve your memory.
